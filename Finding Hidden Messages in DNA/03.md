# 1.1 Do We Have a 'Clock' Gene?

## 1. Circadian Clock in Organisms
- The internal circadian clock regulates daily biological rhythms in animals, plants, and even bacteria.
- It functions continuously, as evidenced by individuals maintaining a ~24-hour cycle in total darkness.
- Malfunctions in the clock can lead to genetic disorders like **Delayed Sleep-Phase Syndrome (DSPS)**.

## 2. Molecular Basis of the Circadian Clock
- The clock operates at a cellular level, influencing protein production.
- Questions arise regarding how cells regulate protein synthesis, why some health conditions (e.g., heart attacks in the morning, asthma at night) align with the clock, and which genes cause circadian dysfunction.

## 3. Discovery of Circadian Genes
- **Ron Konopka and Seymour Benzer (1970s)**: Identified mutant flies with altered circadian rhythms linked to a single gene.
- **1990s**: A similar gene was discovered in mammals, revealing the complexity of circadian regulation.
- **More circadian genes discovered**: Named **timeless, clock, and cycle**, these genes regulate hundreds of others and are conserved across species.

## 4. Circadian Clock in Plants
- Essential for survival, influencing genes involved in **photosynthesis, photoreception, and flowering**.
- Over **1,000 plant genes** follow circadian rhythms.
- Each **plant cell tracks time independently** using a small set of master genes.

## 5. Key Circadian Genes in Plants
- **LHY, CCA1, and TOC1** are master regulators.
- They operate in a **negative feedback loop**:
  - **TOC1** promotes **LHY & CCA1**.
  - **LHY & CCA1** repress **TOC1**.
- **Sunlight triggers LHY & CCA1**, which in turn suppress TOC1.
- At night, **LHY & CCA1 levels decrease**, allowing TOC1 transcription to peak, restarting the cycle.

## 6. Regulatory Mechanisms of Circadian Genes
- These genes produce **transcription factors**, proteins that turn other genes on/off.
- Transcription factors bind to **regulatory motifs (short DNA sequences)** in gene upstream regions (600-1000 nucleotides).
- Example: **CCA1 binds to AAAAAATCT** to regulate gene expression.

## 7. Challenges in Identifying Regulatory Motifs
- **Regulatory motifs are not always identical** (e.g., CCA1 may also bind AAGAACTCT).
- To find these **hidden motifs**, scientists develop **motif-finding algorithms**.

This research helps uncover how circadian rhythms function across species, from plants to humans, with broad implications for health and genetics.

# 1.2 Motif Finding Is More Difficult Than You Think


### Steve Kay's Experiment (2000)
- **Objective:** Used DNA arrays to find genes in *Arabidopsis thaliana* activated by circadian rhythms.
- **Method:** Extracted upstream regions of nearly 500 genes showing circadian behavior.
- **Finding:** Identified a frequent motif, **"AAAATATCT,"** found 46 times.

### Problem with Concatenating DNA Sequences
- Concatenating upstream gene regions into one sequence to find motifs can be misleading.
- This method may result in frequent words that do not actually represent biological motifs.

### Exercise - Expected Occurrence of 9-mer
  - The probability of a 9-mer occurring in random DNA sequences was calculated using the formula for probability of a nucleotide occurring at each position.
  - For each nucleotide in a sequence, the chance of occurrence is 0.25. Therefore, the probability of a specific 9-mer is **(0.25)^9**.
  - For a sequence of length 1000, there are **992 possible positions** for a 9-mer (1000 - 9 + 1 = 992).
  - The total probability across all 500 sequences is computed by multiplying the probability of a 9-mer at each position by the number of sequences and positions.
  - The formula used is: **500 * 992 * (0.25)^9**.

### Evening Element in Arabidopsis
- The **"evening element"** (AAAATATCT) was validated as the circadian motif for gene expression.
- The motif was highly conserved across plants, making it easy to find.

### Less Conserved Motifs
- **Example:** NF-κB binding sites in *Drosophila melanogaster* with immune response genes.
- These motifs are less conserved, making them harder to detect, even though they are functionally important.
- Sequence variability across different occurrences of the motif makes them challenging to identify.

### Hidden Motif Finding Challenge
- Hidden motifs in DNA sequences, like transcription factor binding sites, can be hard to identify, especially if there are variations or mutations.


### Mutation of Motif
- The motif was mutated at **four random positions** and inserted into different DNA strings, making it harder to detect using traditional methods.
- The mutated motif no longer appears in the sequences exactly as the original, thus challenging algorithms designed for exact motif detection.

### Motif Finding Algorithms - Frequent Words Problem
- The challenge is finding motifs with mutations scattered across multiple DNA strings, making common algorithms for detecting frequent patterns ineffective.
- Traditional approaches like the **Frequent Words with Mismatches Problem** are not efficient for longer motifs with more mutations.

### Brute Force Solution - Implanted Motif Problem
- A brute force solution involves generating all **k-mers** in a sequence and checking for motifs that match with up to **'d' mismatches** in all sequences.
- This method checks every possible k-mer and its variations across all DNA strings.

### MotifEnumeration Algorithm
- The algorithm enumerates all **(k, d)-motifs** (motifs of length k with up to d mismatches).
- It collects all motifs that match the criteria in each DNA string and removes duplicates.

### Challenges of MotifEnumeration
- The brute force algorithm is **slow** for large values of **k** and **d**, making it impractical for large datasets.
- Alternative approaches to motif detection are being explored due to its inefficiency.

### Subtle Motif Problem
- The **Subtle Motif Problem** involves detecting a 15-mer motif with **4 random mutations** inserted into 600-nucleotide-long DNA sequences.
- This problem tests the algorithm's ability to detect subtle variations in motifs that are biologically relevant but difficult to identify computationally.

# 1.3 Scoring Motifs

## **1. Limitations of the Implanted Motif Problem**
- The Implanted Motif Problem assumes that every sequence contains the motif, which is unrealistic in biological experiments.
- Real datasets are noisy; some sequences may not contain the regulatory motif.
- Instead of searching for exact motifs, a scoring function is needed to evaluate how well selected k-mers resemble an "ideal" motif.

## **2. Constructing a Motif Matrix**
- Given a set of **t** DNA sequences of length **n**, a **motif matrix** is a **t × k** matrix of selected k-mers.
- The most **frequent** nucleotide in each column is identified (shown in uppercase).
- The goal is to find the **most conserved** motif matrix (fewest variations).

## **3. Scoring a Motif Matrix**
- **Score(Motifs)** is the number of less frequent (lowercase) nucleotides.
- Lower **Score(Motifs)** indicates a more conserved motif.
- The minimum score is **0** (all k-mers are identical).
- The **maximum score** is calculated assuming random nucleotide distribution in each column.

## **4. Count and Profile Matrices**
- **Count Matrix (Count(Motifs))**: A **4 × k** matrix storing nucleotide counts for each column.
- **Profile Matrix (Profile(Motifs))**: Normalized count matrix where each element represents the frequency of a nucleotide in a column.
- The sum of each column in the profile matrix equals **1**.

## **5. Consensus String**
- The **consensus string** is derived from the most frequent nucleotide in each column of the motif matrix.
- Serves as an **approximate regulatory motif** for given DNA sequences.

## **6. Towards a Better Scoring Function**
- A simple **Score(Motifs)** treats all deviations equally, which is biologically inaccurate.
- Some motif positions tolerate multiple nucleotides with similar binding properties.
- A more **conserved** position should be weighted lower in the scoring function.

## **7. Entropy as a Scoring Metric**
- **Entropy (H)** measures uncertainty in a probability distribution:

  H(p1, ..., pN) = - Σ (pi * log2(pi))

- Example:
  - A **random column** (e.g., A: 0.2, C: 0.6, G: 0.0, T: 0.2) has **higher entropy**:

    H ≈ 1.371

  - A **more conserved column** (e.g., C: 0.6, T: 0.4) has **lower entropy**:

    H ≈ 0.971

  - A **highly conserved column** (e.g., G: 0.9, A: 0.1) has **very low entropy**:

    H ≈ 0.467

- **Minimum Entropy**: H = 0 (completely conserved column).
- **Maximum Entropy**: H = 2 (all nucleotides equally likely, 0.25 each).

## **8. Motif Logos for Visualization**
- A **motif logo** is a graphical representation of motif conservation.
- The **height of letters** in a column corresponds to **nucleotide frequency**.
- The **total column height** is determined by **information content**:

  Information Content = 2 - H(p1, ..., pN)

- **Highly conserved columns** appear **tall** in the motif logo.

## **Conclusion**
- **Score(Motifs)** is a simple but limited metric.
- **Entropy** provides a **better scoring function** by capturing nucleotide variability.
- **Motif logos** help visualize conserved regions in DNA sequences.

# 1.4 From Motif Finding to Finding a Median String

## **1. Motif Finding Problem**
- Given a set of DNA sequences, find a **set of k-mers** (one from each sequence) that minimizes the motif score.
- **Input**: A collection of DNA strings and an integer `k`.
- **Output**: A collection of k-mers with the lowest score.
- **BruteForceMotifSearch Algorithm**:
  - Examines all possible k-mer selections.
  - Computes the score for each selection.
  - **Time Complexity**: `O(n^t * k * t)` (exponential in `t`), making it inefficient.

---

## **2. Reformulating the Problem**
- Instead of finding **Motifs → Consensus(Motifs)**, the approach is reversed:
  - **Consensus(Motifs) → Motifs**.
- **Score Calculation Alternative**:
  - Score was previously computed **column-by-column**.
  - Now computed **row-by-row**, which equals the sum of **Hamming distances** between each motif and the consensus.

---

## **3. Equivalent Motif Finding Problem**
- Instead of finding motifs that minimize **Score(Motifs)**, we find a **consensus string** that minimizes the total distance from the motifs.
- **Equivalent Problem Definition**:
  - **Input**: DNA sequences and integer `k`.
  - **Output**: A k-mer and its corresponding motif set minimizing the distance measure.

---

## **4. The Median String Problem**
- Reformulating again, instead of finding both **Pattern** and **Motifs**, we **first find a Pattern** and then compute Motifs.
- **Motifs(Pattern, Dna)**:
  - The optimal set of k-mers given a consensus Pattern.
  - Selected **one at a time** from each sequence to minimize Hamming distance.
- **d(Pattern, Text)**:
  - Minimum Hamming distance between **Pattern** and any k-mer in **Text**.
  - Example: `d(GATTCTCA, GCAAAGACGCTGACCAA) = 3`.
- **Motif(Pattern, Text)**:
  - A k-mer in Text achieving the minimum distance.
  - If multiple exist, the **first** occurrence is chosen.

---

## **5. Finding the Median String**
- **d(Pattern, Dna)**:
  - Sum of minimum distances across all DNA sequences.
- **Goal**: Find a **Pattern** minimizing `d(Pattern, Dna)`.
- **Median String Problem Definition**:
  - **Input**: DNA sequences and integer `k`.
  - **Output**: A k-mer minimizing `d(Pattern, Dna)`.

---

## **6. Brute Force Solution for Median String**
- **Algorithm (Pseudocode)**:
  ```plaintext
  MedianString(Dna, k)
      distance ← ∞
      for each k-mer Pattern from AA…AA to TT…TT
          if distance > d(Pattern, Dna)
               distance ← d(Pattern, Dna)
               Median ← Pattern
      return Median
  ```
- **Complexity**:
  - Evaluates **4^k** possible patterns.
  - Each evaluation requires `O(k * n * t)` operations.
  - **Total Time Complexity**: `O(4^k * n * k * t)`.
  - Compared to **BruteForceMotifSearch** (`O(n^t * k * t)`), this approach is more efficient when `k ≤ 20`.

---

## **7. Code Challenge**
- Given `k` and a set of DNA sequences, implement **MedianString**.
- **Sample Input**:
  ```
  3
  AAATTGACGCAT GACGACCACGTT CGTCAGCGCCTG GCTGAGCACCGG AGTTCGGGACAG
  ```
- **Sample Output**:
  ```
  GAC
  ```

---

## **8. Why Reformulate the Problem?**
- **BruteForceMotifSearch** is **exponential in `t`**.
- **MedianString** is **exponential in `k`**, which is usually ≤ 20.
- **Practical Improvement**:
  - **BruteForceMotifSearch**: `O(n^t * k * t)`.
  - **MedianString**: `O(4^k * n * k * t)`.
  - As `k` is small and `t` is large, **MedianString is often more efficient**.
