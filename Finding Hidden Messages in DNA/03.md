# 1.1 Do We Have a 'Clock' Gene?

## 1. Circadian Clock in Organisms
- The internal circadian clock regulates daily biological rhythms in animals, plants, and even bacteria.
- It functions continuously, as evidenced by individuals maintaining a ~24-hour cycle in total darkness.
- Malfunctions in the clock can lead to genetic disorders like **Delayed Sleep-Phase Syndrome (DSPS)**.

## 2. Molecular Basis of the Circadian Clock
- The clock operates at a cellular level, influencing protein production.
- Questions arise regarding how cells regulate protein synthesis, why some health conditions (e.g., heart attacks in the morning, asthma at night) align with the clock, and which genes cause circadian dysfunction.

## 3. Discovery of Circadian Genes
- **Ron Konopka and Seymour Benzer (1970s)**: Identified mutant flies with altered circadian rhythms linked to a single gene.
- **1990s**: A similar gene was discovered in mammals, revealing the complexity of circadian regulation.
- **More circadian genes discovered**: Named **timeless, clock, and cycle**, these genes regulate hundreds of others and are conserved across species.

## 4. Circadian Clock in Plants
- Essential for survival, influencing genes involved in **photosynthesis, photoreception, and flowering**.
- Over **1,000 plant genes** follow circadian rhythms.
- Each **plant cell tracks time independently** using a small set of master genes.

## 5. Key Circadian Genes in Plants
- **LHY, CCA1, and TOC1** are master regulators.
- They operate in a **negative feedback loop**:
  - **TOC1** promotes **LHY & CCA1**.
  - **LHY & CCA1** repress **TOC1**.
- **Sunlight triggers LHY & CCA1**, which in turn suppress TOC1.
- At night, **LHY & CCA1 levels decrease**, allowing TOC1 transcription to peak, restarting the cycle.

## 6. Regulatory Mechanisms of Circadian Genes
- These genes produce **transcription factors**, proteins that turn other genes on/off.
- Transcription factors bind to **regulatory motifs (short DNA sequences)** in gene upstream regions (600-1000 nucleotides).
- Example: **CCA1 binds to AAAAAATCT** to regulate gene expression.

## 7. Challenges in Identifying Regulatory Motifs
- **Regulatory motifs are not always identical** (e.g., CCA1 may also bind AAGAACTCT).
- To find these **hidden motifs**, scientists develop **motif-finding algorithms**.

This research helps uncover how circadian rhythms function across species, from plants to humans, with broad implications for health and genetics.

# 1.2 Motif Finding Is More Difficult Than You Think


### Steve Kay's Experiment (2000)
- **Objective:** Used DNA arrays to find genes in *Arabidopsis thaliana* activated by circadian rhythms.
- **Method:** Extracted upstream regions of nearly 500 genes showing circadian behavior.
- **Finding:** Identified a frequent motif, **"AAAATATCT,"** found 46 times.

### Problem with Concatenating DNA Sequences
- Concatenating upstream gene regions into one sequence to find motifs can be misleading.
- This method may result in frequent words that do not actually represent biological motifs.

### Exercise - Expected Occurrence of 9-mer
  - The probability of a 9-mer occurring in random DNA sequences was calculated using the formula for probability of a nucleotide occurring at each position.
  - For each nucleotide in a sequence, the chance of occurrence is 0.25. Therefore, the probability of a specific 9-mer is **(0.25)^9**.
  - For a sequence of length 1000, there are **992 possible positions** for a 9-mer (1000 - 9 + 1 = 992).
  - The total probability across all 500 sequences is computed by multiplying the probability of a 9-mer at each position by the number of sequences and positions.
  - The formula used is: **500 * 992 * (0.25)^9**.

### Evening Element in Arabidopsis
- The **"evening element"** (AAAATATCT) was validated as the circadian motif for gene expression.
- The motif was highly conserved across plants, making it easy to find.

### Less Conserved Motifs
- **Example:** NF-ÎºB binding sites in *Drosophila melanogaster* with immune response genes.
- These motifs are less conserved, making them harder to detect, even though they are functionally important.
- Sequence variability across different occurrences of the motif makes them challenging to identify.

### Hidden Motif Finding Challenge
- Hidden motifs in DNA sequences, like transcription factor binding sites, can be hard to identify, especially if there are variations or mutations.


### Mutation of Motif
- The motif was mutated at **four random positions** and inserted into different DNA strings, making it harder to detect using traditional methods.
- The mutated motif no longer appears in the sequences exactly as the original, thus challenging algorithms designed for exact motif detection.

### Motif Finding Algorithms - Frequent Words Problem
- The challenge is finding motifs with mutations scattered across multiple DNA strings, making common algorithms for detecting frequent patterns ineffective.
- Traditional approaches like the **Frequent Words with Mismatches Problem** are not efficient for longer motifs with more mutations.

### Brute Force Solution - Implanted Motif Problem
- A brute force solution involves generating all **k-mers** in a sequence and checking for motifs that match with up to **'d' mismatches** in all sequences.
- This method checks every possible k-mer and its variations across all DNA strings.

### MotifEnumeration Algorithm
- The algorithm enumerates all **(k, d)-motifs** (motifs of length k with up to d mismatches).
- It collects all motifs that match the criteria in each DNA string and removes duplicates.

### Challenges of MotifEnumeration
- The brute force algorithm is **slow** for large values of **k** and **d**, making it impractical for large datasets.
- Alternative approaches to motif detection are being explored due to its inefficiency.

### Subtle Motif Problem
- The **Subtle Motif Problem** involves detecting a 15-mer motif with **4 random mutations** inserted into 600-nucleotide-long DNA sequences.
- This problem tests the algorithm's ability to detect subtle variations in motifs that are biologically relevant but difficult to identify computationally.
